# *'Unbeatable' Tic Tac Toe Engine*

## Description
__*A single or two player tic tac toe engine made in Java*__  
For this project I made a graphical tic tac toe engine / game.  
The project has both a single player and a two player mode.  Single  
player mode utilizes the MiniMax algorithm to determine the next  
best move.  I used this algorithm to implement a basic AI player.  
Two player mode allows the user to play against another person on  
the same computer. The project also implements basic settings and stats,  
as well as simple animations. 

## Why
I chose to create this project for a couple of reasons. First, I have always  
been interesting in making games, and this strengthened my fundamental skills  
for game development.  On top of this, it allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge  
of Java, which is the language I have the most experience in.

2. Double click on the TTT.jar file to run the project.  
NOTE: **Save feature does not work when running as jar file** 
## Command Line  
1. Download the 'bin' folder
2. Open a terminal / command prompt 
3. Navigate to the downloaded 'bin' folder (if unfamiliar with how to do this see the references below)

4. Type and run the following command from inside of the 'bin' folder:  
java Driver  
NOTE: **Save feature only works when running from command line**

# Examples / Screenshots  

# Current Issues
1. When running from the .jar file, the save feature does not work.  
The settings, and stats do not get saved to the 'SaveData' file.
# Future Add Ons  
1. Find a way to save the data when running from a .jar file
2. Add more settings that allow the user to further customize their games
3. Add color themes allowing the user to change the look of the project
4. Use a more efficient algorithm than MiniMax
5. Add support for games on boards larger than 3x3
